Happy New Year, readers! 

I hope you had a wonderful time off with your loved ones during the holiday season. As we begin a new year, let's all strive to make it our best one yet. Here's to a great weekend and an even better year ahead!


There are several options that can address both security and the needs of the delivery team. 

Bottom of the pyramid:

**1. SAST or Unit Tests:** One such option is unit tests or static code analysis tests (also known as static application security testing or SAST). These tests examine source code or compiled code for security vulnerabilities. By fixing any issues identified by these tests before committing code to the source code management tool, we can prevent security problems from reaching the production environment.

Middle layers of the pyramid:

**2. Dependency scanning:** It's important to regularly check third-party and open-source dependencies for vulnerabilities. Security teams often maintain a list of approved dependencies that developers can use when building new features for an application. Performing thorough scans of these dependencies helps ensure that the application remains secure.

**3. Image Scanning:** 

**4. Container Scanning:**

**5. Network Scanning:**

**6. IAST - Interactive Application Security Testing:**

**7. RASP - Runtime Application Self Protection:**

**8. DAST - Dynamic Application Security Testing:**

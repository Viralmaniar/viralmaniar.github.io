Happy New Year, readers! 

I hope you had a wonderful time off with your loved ones during the holiday season. As we begin a new year, let's all strive to make it our best one yet. Here's to a great weekend and an even better year ahead!


There are several options that can address both security and the needs of the delivery team. 

SAST or Unit Tests: One such option is unit tests or static code analysis tests (also known as static application security testing or SAST). These tests examine source code or compiled code for security vulnerabilities. By fixing any issues identified by these tests before committing code to the source code management tool, we can prevent security problems from reaching the production environment.

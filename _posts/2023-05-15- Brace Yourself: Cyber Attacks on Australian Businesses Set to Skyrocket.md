As Australians, we are known for being tough when faced with challenges. We've survived bushfires, floods, and even a global pandemic. But the latest threat to our way of life comes in the form of a new wave of cyber attacks on our businesses and organisations.

Recent threat intelligence suggests that big, targeted attacks are on the horizon for Australian businesses. And unfortunately, it's only going to get worse in the coming weeks.

After conducting some investigation in the past few days, I have discovered that there are several groups located in Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia that are actively aiming their cyber attacks towards Australian businesses. This information was gathered through OSINT, SOCINT & scrapping/digging on various dark site and hacker forums, which involved the use of various tools and techniques to analyse the source and nature of these attacks.

It seems these groups are particularly interested in gaining unauthorised access to sensitive data belonging to Australian businesses. It is important to note that these attacks are not random, but rather, they are carefully targeted and focused on specific organisations.

Below sharing some screenshots of chats and the leak:

Leaked SQL databases consisting of sensitive information

As depicted in the following screenshots, an enormous amount of personally identifiable information (PII) data can be observed, consisting of thousands upon thousands of lines. This quantity of sensitive information underscores the seriousness and scope of the potential data breach, highlighting the urgent need for swift action to mitigate the potential harm to affected individuals.

Moreover, they have disclosed the names of 41 business websites that were shut down as a result of attacks on their primary websites. This includes multiple organisations in various service lines such as transportation, universities, energy, health, and government offices.

The motives behind these attacks are varied and complex, but they may include financial gain, corporate espionage, or even political influence. Whatever the motivation may be, it is clear that these groups pose a significant threat to Australian businesses and must be dealt with accordingly.

The consequences of a successful cyber attack can be devastating. Not only can it result in the loss of sensitive data, but it can also damage a business's reputation and cause significant financial harm.

So what can we do to protect ourselves? The first step is to acknowledge that the threat is real and take it seriously. This means implementing strong cybersecurity measures and investing in the right tools and technologies.

But it's not just about technology. It's also about creating a culture of security within our businesses. This means educating our employees on the risks and best practices for staying safe online.

At the end of the day, the cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving. But by staying vigilant and taking proactive measures, we can reduce our risk and protect ourselves from the worst of it.

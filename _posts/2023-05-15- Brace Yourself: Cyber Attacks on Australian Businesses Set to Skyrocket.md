Brace Yourself: Cyber Attacks on Australian Businesses Set to Skyrocket

As Australians, we are known for being tough when faced with challenges. We've survived bushfires, floods, and even a global pandemic. But the latest threat to our way of life comes in the form of a new wave of cyber attacks on our businesses and organisations.

Recent threat intelligence suggests that big, targeted attacks are on the horizon for Australian businesses. And unfortunately, it's only going to get worse in the coming weeks.

After conducting some investigation in the past few days, I have discovered that there are several groups located in Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia that are actively aiming their cyber attacks towards Australian businesses. This information was gathered through OSINT, SOCINT & scrapping/digging on various dark site and hacker forums, which involved the use of various tools and techniques to analyse the source and nature of these attacks.

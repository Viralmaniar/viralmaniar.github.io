## Who am I?

I am a dedicated sr. security specialist in Australia with over 11 years of experience in information security and management. Prior to working for Cyware, I held senior positions at Microsoft, RiskIQ, Threat Intelligence, KPMG and Ernst & Young. I have provided security consulting services including infrastructure (internal - external), application penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, wireless penetration testing, social engineering, red team engagements, API testing, Thick & Thin client testing and cloud architecture security reviews to numerous clients across various industries in the APAC region.

I was involved with the RISC (RMIT Information Security Collective) Club while at University and worked as a Developer for firewall security at Biarri Networks where I developed a visualisation algorithm to solve the issue of firewall rules management.

I have participated in a number of bug bounty programs and won awards for responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in web and mobile applications from companies such as Adobe, Apple, Google Chromium, IBM, C2FO, Blinksale, Appfog, TEDmed and many more. In my leisure time, I enjoy developing security tools and maintain a number of projects on GitHub. I have achieved industry certifications such as Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) and SANS GPEN - Network Penetration Testing.

I feel blessed that I work in the security industry as there is always something new almost every day. No two engagements are the same and there's a lot to be learned while performing penetration testing, integration development, security automation and architecting a security project.
